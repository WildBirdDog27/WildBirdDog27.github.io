Hello, I am James Gibson. This is the homepage of my github pages website. Currently I am in my Junior year as an Electrical Engineering student with a focus in Robotics, Controls, and Autonomy. I have lived in Blacksburg for over 10 years, and Virginia my whole life. Over time I have changed my planned major from Computer Science, to Computer Engineering, and now finally Electrical Engineering.
